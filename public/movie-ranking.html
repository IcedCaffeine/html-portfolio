<h1>Best Movies and Shows according to Fahad</h1>
<h2>Based on what I've watched over the last decade</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lucifer (show)</h3>
<p>I love his style and personality. Not to mention the corvette he drives around in.</p>
<h3>Legend (movie)</h3>
<p>Tom hardy plays the role of two twin crime bosses so well. It's a must watch</p>
<h3>Mad Men</h3>
<p>John Hamm is just so cool. Downside is this show will make you want to smoke.</p>
<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>Just such a boss show with amazing characters. This show will also make you think smoking is cool.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Probably one of my favorite movie of all time. I've watched it 4 times. I recommed most of Questin Tarantino's movies.</p>
