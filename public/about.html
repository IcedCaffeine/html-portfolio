<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Fahad Abdul Rahman, a passionate and innovative software developer on the brink of completing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at Concordia University. My journey in technology is driven by my curiosity and a relentless pursuit of solving complex problems, especially those that intersect with healthcare and technology.
  
  My programming skills span across a variety of languages and frameworks, including C++, Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and ASP.Net. This diverse skill set, coupled with my proficiency in Agile and Scrum methodologies, enables me to adapt to various development environments and contribute effectively to team projects.</p>

<p>During my internship at Genetec Inc., I honed my skills in feature development, requirement analysis, and collaborative programming. I worked closely with the UX team and end-users to define feature requirements, ensuring our solutions were user-centric and impactful. My role also involved breaking down features into manageable work items and developing them in a scalable and extensible manner. This experience has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also enhanced my communication and teamwork skills.</p>

<p>Beyond the professional sphere, I have engaged in several academic projects that have further solidified my expertise. Notably, my participation in the Autonomous Hovercraft Competition at Concordia University, where I was integral in designing, building, and programming a hovercraft, led our team to secure the second position among 18 competing teams. This project was a testament to my critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills.

<p>A notable achievement was my third-year engineering project, where my team and I developed a CPR device. This device measures the depth and rhythm of chest compressions during CPR, ensuring they are performed correctly. 
  We designed a complementary mobile app that guides users through proper CPR procedures and provides real-time feedback on compression rhythm and depth. This project was not only a technical success but also earned us an award at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's awards ceremony, reflecting our commitment to impactful healthcare innovations.

<p>Currently, I'm engrossed in my capstone project, which is at the intersection of healthcare and technology â€” a domain I'm deeply passionate about. We are developing a comprehensive remote patient monitoring and hospital room management system. This system includes a health-monitoring bracelet that transmits vital patient data to a mobile app accessible to nurses. Additionally, it features a web application aided by AI to predict patient stay lengths and assist in room assignments. This project not only showcases my technical prowess but also my commitment to leveraging technology for impactful healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>My interest in healthcare technology is rooted in my academic background in Health Sciences from Vanier College. This unique combination of healthcare knowledge and technical expertise positions me uniquely in the tech industry, especially in fields where these two domains overlap.</p>

<p>As I embark on my professional journey, I bring a mix of technical skills, innovative thinking, and a commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit. I am eager to explore opportunities that challenge me and allow me to make meaningful contributions, particularly in projects at the nexus of healthcare and technology.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
